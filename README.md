# pet-management-back-end

## Description ##

This is the back end for pet management app made for Wisercat test assignment. The front end of that same app can be found here https://github.com/WhiteLynks/pet-management-front-end . Both back end and front end must be running for app to work.

## Running back end ##

To run the back end either run java class called PetManagementBackEndApplication.java in your favorite IDE. Alternatively, running the command `mvn spring-boot:run` in project root directory should work too

## Time spent on assignment ##

Roughly 3 evenings/nights

## Unfinished features ##
List on things I wanted to add but couldn't due to time constraints:

* Data validation on back end
* Tests
* Basic user validation with spring security
* Pet details page
